# Hypogeum

The objective of the project is to create a fantasy autobattler game.

- Roope Huttunen: Project Manager
- Iiro Jaakkola: Programmer
- Samu Vesiluoma: Designer
- Arttu Karjalainen: Artisti
- Juuso Nisu: Programmer

We use discord as a means of communication between members.

We hold team meeting when needed, usually on fridays after the tutoring session and on mondays to reaffirm what needs to be done during the week.
On thursdays we check what has been done during the work week.

We used gitlab issued to track progress and used time estimates on issues to estimate time required to finish said tasks

# Final report

## Summary of what we did

We completed a prototype for a fantasy autobattler where you can select your gladiators, place them, equip them with items that drop from enemies or are bought from the shop and can battle through the four levels to reach the boss level to fight the minotaur boss in order to beat the game.

The design and ideation process went quite well along with the creation of great looking assets. The game itself was maybe a bit too complex and had a lot of moving parts thus the coding part was a bit lacking in the end product due to the numerous systems needed.

The game could be polished a bit more and needs some cleanup before the implementation of new features such as meta progression and additional levels.

During the course Juuso seemed to start falling behind and near the halfway mark was pretty much completely absent from the projectwork leading to delays in feature implementation.

## Self evaluation and suggested grade for the project

We did not manage to accomplish everything we set out to do due to simply not having enough time to spend on the project and sometimes a bit of a lack of motivation.

We would suggest a greade of 2 or 3 for our course as we did create a working game prototype and did spend a lot of time and effort on it. 3 based on what we accomplished but the grade could drop to 2 based on the lacking documentation.

## Self evaluations and suggested grades for the project members

### Roope

I did the most hours as a programmer and also did the project managing which did lead to poorer documentation as I shared the main programmer and project manager roles.
I would grade myself a 3 for the amount of effort and time I had to spend on this course. My goals for the course weren't that high to begin with so I'm pretty satisfied with what I achieved. Though the project managing part of the course did not go so well as I didn't really want to be a project manager it just kind of fell on me as someone had to take the role.

### Iiro

I did programming mostly, some animation blueprints, menu design, searching assets from unity store and writing these documents. 
I would grade myself 3, but definitly not more than Roope who did the most for the project. I hope we could have had been able put more time into this project, because it was starting to look pretty nice. (maybe we continue after course).. For me it is hard to study fully online so I had hard time putting as much hours to project as I would have wanted to. 

### Samu

### Arttu
For the project, I mostly did 3D modeling and animation and other design tasks. I was really motivated at the start of the project, but for some reason my motivation kind of died out at some point. I think our vision for the game was a bit too grand. With all the other courses also requiring work, I didn't really manage to dedicate enough hours for this project, which is a shame. 

The models/animations/icons etc. I created for the project were okay, but I definitely should have been more active and participated in programming as well. I definitely would not grade myself higher than Roope or Iiro, who did most of the programming work. I'd give myself a 2 or a 3.
