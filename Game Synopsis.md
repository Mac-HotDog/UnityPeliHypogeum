# Game  - Synopsis

### Core idea

The game is a roguelike fantasy autobattler where you decide on a team upon starting a run and upgrade said team with items and new abilities throughout the run. During the deployment part of the combat you can decide the first actions your characters will make. The player can if they choose use the abilities how they want during the combat.

When the player loses (all characters die) they will gain some currency which they can spend on permanent uprades to make their later runs easier.

Found abilities can be equipped to any character but some have modifiers making certain types more powerful

### Game development 

The motivation for the player in the game is to clear the levels and beat the endboss but this might not be possible initially due to the difficulty.
